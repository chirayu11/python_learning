### Insertion Sort

- Going through the second element of the array to the last element one by one in the outer loop.
- Let's say we are using index i in the outer loop. Everything less than index i is in sorted order (as we've sorted in previous iterations). We're basically trying to insert number at position i, into that pre-sorted array. Hence the name.
